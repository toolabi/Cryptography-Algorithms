# Cryptography-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and exercises for various cryptographic algorithms. It is designed to help developers and enthusiasts understand the principles of cryptography through hands-on coding.

## Features

- Implementation of key cryptographic algorithms such as:
  - Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DONE)
  - RSA Encryption/Decryption (PENDIND ...)
  - AES Symmetric Encryption (PENDIND ...)
  - Hashing Algorithms (SHA, MD5, etc.) (PENDIND ...)
- Examples and exercises to reinforce understanding. (PENDIND ...)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (if working with Rust-based implementations)
- Basic understanding of cryptographic principles.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cryptography-Algorithms.git
   cd Cryptography-Algorithms
